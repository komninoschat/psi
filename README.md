# PSI [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/pascal-psi/community.svg)](https://gitter.im/pascal-psi/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

---
This project evolved into [GLO](https://github.com/komninoschat/glo). I do not intent to continue maintaining this and would like to point out that it still contains many unfixed bugs
---


This is a Work-in-Progress ISO 7185 Pascal interpreter I am building in order to get confident with lexers, parsers, interpreters and all that good stuff. All PRs are welcomed and for any question you can join our [gitter chat](https://gitter.im/pascal-psi/community)!

## Installation

To install the CLI, execute the following command:

```
npm install -g @pascal-psi/cli
```

or with Yarn

```
yarn global add @pascal-psi/cli
```

## Usage

`psi <file to interpret>`

## Demos

There are demo programs you can try running in the [demos](demos) directory

## Build

This project is structured as a monorepo using [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna).

In order to build the project, first install lerna

```
npm install -g lerna
```

or with Yarn:

```
yarn global add lerna
```

And then run `lerna bootstrap` on the root directory. This will install all the dependencies for all the modules and link them together.

If you want to run the CLI, run the `/modules/cli/bin/run` file
